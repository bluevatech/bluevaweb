$723B – The anticipated spend in 2025 across companies to access data stored on the cloud. Most current contracts are written to pay for compute. With the desire of companies to expand their AI usage (estimated at 30% of all cloud compute YTD and rising), efficiency is more important than ever. 
Our software rates the complexity of each query and creates custom analytics on how well each query ran. This will allow for the analysis and resolution of problem queries, while also providing insights into how customers are transforming and using the data provided to them.
Further, our tool creates a data lineage for each object within the query, enabling automated documentation to occur. By leveraging our analytics, teams can prioritize, streamline, and improve the entirety of their code base - not just those IT builds.

## Bad Queries

Poorly written queries can be responsible for a surprising amount of compute cost. Blueva Technologies tools and services can be utilized to help companies keep an eye out for when queries are running longer than they should, and can even kill those queries before undue expenses are incured.

## Unused Tables

As users use Data Assets, certain columns and even tables initially in scope will slowly fall out of favor and into disuse. As a result, IT teams are often paying compute and labor costs to load tables that are not being consumed by downstream end users. Our analytics package will provide usage stats on each table and column in your system, enabling you to make strategic decisions around managing your platform without your team having to spend valuable time tracking down unsused corners of your database.
